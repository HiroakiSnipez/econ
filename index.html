                <div class="answer-box" id="answer2">
                    <p class="answer">Due to higher prices, there is a leftwards shift in the short run aggregate supply which indicates that there is a cost push inflation. This is because the prices to produce are higher, which would ultimately lead to a decrease in supply. Furthermore due to energy and food price shocks, it is difficult to keep labor within the market, rising labor costs. If that were to occur then a very crucial factor of production would be affected.</p>

                <div class="answer-box" id="answer3">
                    <p class="answer">There was a rise in production costs, this shortage increased production costs for manufacturers affecting the SRAS curve to shift to the left which indicates the production costs increasing. In addition to that, rent ultimately increases as during the Covid 19 utility costs drastically increased as they were ordered to stay home by the government which affected business all over the country to pause their business which decreased demand. Which will overall decrease aggregate demand due to the reduced consumer spending which resulted in lower revenue overall and shifted the AD curve to the right,</p>

                <div class="answer-box" id="answer4">
                    <p class="answer">All three sectors were heavily impacted, such as the primary sector due to energy supply shortages. The most prominently affected sector was the secondary sector as Germany is known to manufacture but were unable to due to not only supply issues related to energy, labor and food but also chip shortages as many people were going online during COVID. The Tertiary sector was also affected but not as heavily as the secondary manufacturing sector.</p>

                    <h3 class="question">What measures could the government take to address this inflation?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="answer-box" id="answer5">
                    <p class="answer">The government could opt for two types of policies, either fiscal or monetary. As for the Fiscal policy, the government could increase spending on firms and subsidize energy as well as food in order to make it cheaper for the labour to work in Germany and have relief on the factors of production. Another fiscal policy would be to lower taxation on firms, consumers and increase the tax on imported tariffs. 
                        Monetary policies could be assessed in this situation due to the higher interest rates that is being kept by the government which makes it more expensive for business and consumers, which reduces spending and demand in the economy helping to control inflation.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer-box" id="answer6">
                    <p class="answer">They are very effective as this is the one mostly used and its high in reducing inflation caused by excessive demand but also this may slow economic growth and increase unemployment due to the inability to pay back loans with a high interest rate, and the increaseof government spending s also effective due to it reducing demand because of consumers not needing to pay for certain stuff due to the subsidization  and for taxation it will help with managing inflation by reducing consumer spending</p>
